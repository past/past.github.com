      One very obvious change in the last years was that the web became much more mobile.
      Instead of desktop machines we use laptops, smart phones and tablets and all of 
      these devices get more powerful by the month. They all come with different resolutions
      and connectivity issues, though and Mozilla is happy to take on the challenge of 
      moving the open web from immobile machines to on-the-go computing.

      When a certain company very loudly proclaimed that the desktop is dead

      power smartphones we were very happy and interested indeed. Finally 
      web standards got a platform that is on the bleeding edge and very 
      beautiful and we all were ready to chip in to make this an open 
      experience that empowers everyone to build for these new devices.

    <footer class="notes">
      The most frustrating part about this is that phone and operating 
      system providers lock out browsers and JavaScript. The fun parts
      to use in a smartphone are the camera, the sensors and to use it
      to send messages to your friends and call people. To do this, 
      however you'll need to write native code. Browsers, in general
      are locked out. This is not fair when you claim at the same 
      time that HTML5 is the platform to bring a great future.

      At arewemobileyet.com we have a live view of how far down the line

      be used by other browser vendors and are implemented in Firefox. 
      As you can see we are very far down the line, the only thing 
      missing still is USB and NFC connectivity, other than that all 
      that is in your phone can be accessed by JavaScript.

      Firefox OS is build with three components: 
      Gonk is the Linux layer talking to the hardware (the same Android uses)

    <footer class="notes">
      The whole interface of Firefox OS is written in web technologies. This
      means phone or phone service providers can complete change the look, 
      feel and functionality of the phone interface itself. This is something
      completely new and can lead to a lot of great phone innovation for 
      special needs. Consider a kid's phone with three simple buttons or 
      company phones that only have the apps you need for your job and nothing
      else.

      Of course a phone without apps is not going to be very interesting to audiences

      These apps are built with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript and all you need to give us 
      to be part of it is a manifest file.

      The responsive view in Firefox makes it easy to test what your app looks like
      in different resolutions and when you switch from landscape to portrait mode. 
      Instead of resizing the window you resize the document in the browser. It comes
      with lots of presets of the sizes of common phones and tablets and you still
      have access to all the buttons and tabs of your browser.

    <footer class="notes">
      The latest Firefox now allows for remote debugging, which means you 
      can develop on your desktop and see the results on your phone instead
      of having to send code, restart the phone or reload the page and all 
      that pain. With remote debugging you can see what is going on in the 
      code of your HTML5 app on your desktop while testing it in the real
      environment.
